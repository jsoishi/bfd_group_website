abstract = "Taylor-Couette flow is well known to admit a spiral turbulence state in which laminar and turbulent patches coexist around the cylinder. This flow state is quite complex, with delicate internal structure, and it can be traced into certain regimes of linear stability. This behaviour is believed to be connected to the non-normality of the linear operator, which is itself a function of the control parameters. Using spiral turbulence in both linearly stable and unstable regimes, we investigate the effectiveness of the generalized quasi-linear approximation (GQL), an extension of quasi-linear theory designed to capture the essential aspects of turbulent flows. We find that GQL performs much better in the supercritical regime than the subcritical. By including only a small number of modes in the nonlinear interactions, GQL simulations maintain a turbulent-like state when in the supercritical regime. However, a much larger number is required to avoid returning to the laminar state when in the subcritical regime. <P />This article is part of the theme issue `Taylor-Couette and related flows on the centennial of Taylor's seminal Philosophical Transactions paper (part 1)'."
