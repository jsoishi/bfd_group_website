abstract = "The operation of the solar dynamo, with all of its remarkable spatio-temporal ordering, remains an outstanding problem of modern solar physics. A number of mechanisms that might plausibly contribute to its operation have been proposed, but the relative role played by each remains unclear. This uncertainty stems from continuing questions concerning the speed and structure of deep-seated convective flows. Those flows are in-turn thought to sustain both the Sun's turbulent EMF and the large-scale flows of differential rotation and meridional circulation suspected of influencing the dynamo's organization and timing. Continued progress in this area is complicated by (i) inconsistencies between helioseismic measurements of convective and meridional flow made with different techniques and instruments, and (ii) a lack of high-latitude data for convection, differential rotation, and meridional flow. We suggest that the path forward to resolving these difficulties is twofold. First, the acquisition of long-term helioseismic and emissivity measurements obtained from a polar vantage point is vital to complete our picture of the Sun's outer convection zone. Second, sustained and expanded investment in theory-oriented and combined theory/observational research initiatives will be crucial to fully exploit these new observations and to resolve inconsistencies between existing measurements."
