abstract = "We report on optical spectra of the unusual quasar SDSS J153636.22+044127.0, obtained on 2009 March 7.52 UT with the Double Spectrograph on the Palomar 200-inch telescope. This object was recently suggested as a candidate sub-parsec supermassive black hole system by Boroson & Lauer (2009, Nature, 458, 53), based primarily on the existence of two components of the broad Balmer emission lines seen in the SDSS spectrum of the source."
