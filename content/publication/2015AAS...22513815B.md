abstract = "Stars on the lower main sequence have substantial, stratified convection zones that span many density scale heights. There, low Mach number convection dominates the transport of heat, angular momentum and the dynamo generation of magnetic fields. Many aspects of low Mach number stratified convection remain unclear. Here we use the open-source Dedalus pseudospectral framework to study for the first time low Mach number fully nonlinear, fully compressible convection in stratified stellar interiors. We study what processes determine the scales of convective motions and the nature of turbulent transport in highly stratified atmospheres."
