# Joining the group

If you're an undergrad at Bates--any year, physics major, potential physics major, or otherwise--send email to [Jeff](mailto:joishi@bates.edu). Browse around the site to get a feel for what we're up to. There are no prerequisites to joining the group; interest in some subset of {math, physics, astronomy, programming, noise rock} is pretty much it. Hell, if you're even a little curious about it, send me an email and let's chat.

## Doing a Senior Thesis
Are you a physics major thinking of doing a senior thesis? We strongly prefer students to do *full year* theses in the group, but if you can't, don't let that stop you.
