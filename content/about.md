# What We Do
How are stellar magnetic fields generated and how do they release energy into planetary systems? How do giant planet atmospheres transport heat horizontally and vertically? How does climate influence planetary habitability? How does rotation affect the evolution and magnetic activity on planetary host stars? All of these questions rest on understanding how the atmospheres of planets and the interiors of stars transport chemical species, angular momentum, and energy. At the Bates AFD Lab, we are finding the answers to those questions by using computer simulation and mathematical tools. We're [always looking for Bates students!]({{<ref "vacancy/vacancy1.md">}})
