# Guide to Getting Started

Welcome to the Bates Fluid Dynamics Group! Most of our work involves solving partial differential equations by computer. Typically, this means running simulations on supercomputers, most often the Leavitt cluster here at Bates.

## Resources

### Using Linux ###

All of the group's software runs on Linux. You need to be familiar with the command line, and it helps to know a bit of bash shell scripting. We use the `git` version control system.

All of this is taught in PHYS s10, but if you haven't taken it, don't fear! Here are some resources.

* Intro to command line
* wikipedia command line programs list. This is very helpful!
* Intro to git 

### Local Bates Resources ###

* Leavitt is our 476 core, 17 node compute cluster. Managed by the Bates High Performance Computing Center, it's where we do most of our runs
* `a23637.bates.edu` is our group workstation. It's available via ssh from on campus, and has 256 GB of memory for big data analysis and small runs. If you need an account on it, just ask Jeff.
* [SLURM]() Leavitt uses the SLURM system for running jobs. Unlike your personal computer, when you want to run a calculation on Leavitt, you submit a "run script" to a "queue". When it's your turn in the queue, your job runs and the data is saved to disk. 

### Fluid Dynamics ###

* Fitzpatrick's book?
* [FYFD]() will give you tons of inspiration

### Dedalus ###

* [Dedalus Users Group](https://groups.google.com/dedalus-users/). 
A great place to start. Search the questions first! Often your question has already been answered. If you don't find an answer, send a message. There's over a hundred Dedalus users reading and mailing that list, so chances are someone will know the answer.
