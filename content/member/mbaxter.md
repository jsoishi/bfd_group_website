Morgan wrote his senior thesis on applying the Generalized Quasi-linear Approximation to Taylor-Couette flows. Before that, Morgan completed an [eigenvalue analysis]({{< ref "2020RSPSA.47690622O.md" >}}) of the 3D magnetorotational instability.
As of 2021, he's pursuing a Master's Degree in Aerospace Engineering at University of Colorado, Boulder.
