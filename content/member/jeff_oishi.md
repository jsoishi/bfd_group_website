Jeff develops numerical algorithms and software to model partial differential equations (PDEs). He uses them to study complicated non-linear flows and turbulence in fluids and plasmas. This involves great students, a lot of coffee, a fair amount of supercomputer time, and a network of great friends and collaborators around the world to work with.

### Hobbies
Loud music, synthesizers, bicycles, cats.
