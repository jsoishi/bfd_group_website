As we start the winter term, we welcome two new members to our ranks.
First, [Anthony Okonkwo (Bates '20)](/member/aokonkwo) joins the group as a senior thesis student working on fluid-structure interaction and modelling Taylor's swimming sheet using immersed boundary methods in Dedalus.
Anthony is majoring in physics and engineering and is particularly interested in mechanical engineering.
Second, [Muhammad Abdullah (Bates '22)](/member/mabdulla) is joining the group as a research student.
He's just getting started on instability theory, with an eye on helping to design a Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke lab experiment.
