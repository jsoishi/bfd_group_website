We released the beta version of Dedalus version 3 just under a year ago, on 15 Feb 2022. In that time, we've made tremendous progress in performance, usability, and IO. One thing that's always gratifying is when you port a script as closely as you can, by copying and pasting and modifying until it conforms to the new syntax and find this:

And for the one run I checked, Dedalus 3 is 2.4 times faster than Dedalus 2! Not a bad start to a holiday weekend.
