# Research

## Mission

The Bates Fluid Dynamics Group study fluid dynamics at scales ranging from global models of planets and stars to the swimming and growth of bacteria with theoretical and computational tools. We are particularly interested in what we call "complicated" fluid dynamics: problems involving turbulence, phase changes, traditional "complex" non-Newtonian fluids, or some combination of them all. We make extensive use of the [Dedalus Project](http://dedalus-project.org), a flexible framework for solving partial differential equations. 

A key goal of the group is to provide solid training in computational science, fluid dynamics, and applied mathematics to a diverse group of undergraduate researchers. 

**If you're a Bates undergrad interested in learning more, get in touch!**
