# Research

## Mission

We study the basic physics of stellar and planetary fluid dynamics with theoretical and computational tools. We are interested in understanding the organization of large-scale structures, including stellar magnetic fields, and the jets and vortices on gas giant planets. In particular, we study the small scale turbulent processes that build and dissipate these structures. We make extensive use of the [Dedalus Project](http://dedalus-project.org), a flexible framework for solving partial differential equations. 

A key goal of the lab is to provide solid training in computational science, fluid dynamics, and astrophysics to a diverse group of undergraduate researchers.
