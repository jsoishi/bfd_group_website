Turbulence is a crucial part of the climate, the dynamo process by which the Sun and Earth produce magnetic fields, and a major limiting factor for plasma confinement in tokamaks.
In each of these systems, the largest scales are factors of 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>14</sup> times larger than the smallest scales.
Crucially, energy flows through *all* of these scales, impacting the dynamics of the flow.
A complete numerical simulation would require between 10<sup>15</sup> to 10<sup>42</sup> data points **for every moment in time simulated**! This is...not quite feasible. 
One of the particularly interesting questions in out-of-equilibrium systems is how often *extreme events* occur. They are rare, but how rare? What are the statistics of these flows?

We are particularly interested in systems with some form of anisotropy: a preferred direction, which may be imparted by rotation, a strong magnetic field, or a combination of both. In such systems, in addition to energy flowing from large scales to small (or vice versa, in the case of two-dimensional flows), there are often the formation of large scale structures, typically called *zonal flows* or *jets*. You can see one example of this in the image above. The right hand panel shows the plasma density in a simplified model of tokamak turbulence called the modified Hasagawa-Wakatani system. You can see that the system is forming large, coherent structures in the y direction. These are zonal flows.


Instead, we work on developing models and approximation techniques to **reduce** the amount of data we need to store to faithfully recreate the dynamics. We can think of the state of the system as a single point in a 10<sup>42</sup> dimensional space evolving in time. Using this idea, we can imagine projecting onto a lower dimensional space while still maintaining the time history of the state. 

![GQL works by limiting non-linear interactions](/img/GQLtriads.png)

We're particularly interested in the **Generalized Quasilinear Approximation** (GQL) and **Direct Statistical Simulation**. GQL works by decomposing the state vector $\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{X}_l + \mathbf{X}_h$ into *low* and *high* wavenumbers. In the figure above (courtesy of Brad Marston), the top row shows non-linear interactions preserved by GQL and the bottom row shows those it eliminates. $\Lambda$ is the wavenumber delineating low and high.  

We've used GQL to study the [Busse annulus]({{< ref "2018RSPSA.47480422T.md" >}}). Recently, group alum [Morgan Baxter]( {{< ref "mbaxter.md" >}}) wrote some new tools to easily implement GQL in Dedalus. We are currently trying them out on many classic flows including Taylor-Couette, Rayleigh-Benard Convection, and the thermal asymptotic suction boundary layer.
