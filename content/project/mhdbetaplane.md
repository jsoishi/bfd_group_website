## Motivation

Motivated by the discovery of [active nests of convection](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/592397/meta;jsessionid=5C141B62D2437E6E71FCB12C5CBAB662.ip-10-40-1-105) in rapidly rotating stellar simulations, we are interested in constructing a *local* model that can reproduce the phenomena. In order to do this, we're investigating the use of the equatorial beta plane.
